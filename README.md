# Path Tracing
Monte-Carlo path tracing image rendering


### TODO:

* Microfacet model with importance sampling
* Refraction based on Fresnel equations
* Explicit light sampling
* Camera class
* Lens and depth of field support for realistic pictures
* Add more geometric primitives

### Implemented features:

* Sphere primitive
* Lambertian BRDF
* Modified Phong BRDF
* SSAO via tent filter (based on smallpt implementation)
